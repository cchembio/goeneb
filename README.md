The GöNEB code uses the framework of the [Nudged Elastic Band](https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/pubs/jonsson98_385.pdf) method described by Jonsson et.al.

> [!NOTE]
> Only tested with python 3.8, and the exact versions of the libraries given in `requirements.txt`!

# Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cchembio/goeneb.git
   cd goeneb
   ```

---

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

    1. **Select your Python version**<br>
       Ensure you have your desired Python version installed on your system (Python 3.8 is recommended):
       ```bash
       python --version
       ```

    2. **Create the virtual environment**
       ```bash
       python -m venv neb-env
       ```
       Replace `neb-env` with any name you prefer for your environment.

    3. **Activate the environment**
       ```bash
       source neb-env/bin/activate
       ```

    4. **Install required Python modules**

       Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

---

3. **Prepare the shell environment**

   The file `scripts/environment.sh` is used to generate a temporary directory for the calculations, export all environment variables and source the python environment. The lines

   ```bash
   ENV_PATH="/path/to/neb-env/bin/activate"
   NEB_PATH="/path/to/goeneb"
   ```
   need to be changed to the full paths of the python environment and the GöNEB program.

> [!WARNING]
> The `environment.sh` expects the executable of the quantum chemistry program you are planning to use (ORCA, Molpro, Gaussian) to be in the `PATH`. Either permanently, or e.g. by loading the module. If this is not the case, the path to the program needs to be specified here.

---

4. **Test your installation**

   The `scripts/test_NEB.sh` can now be used to start the test module (`testing_module.py`). It tests all the energy calculation interfaces (ORCA, Molpro, Gaussian) and checks whether the calculated values for energies and gradients are similar to the values calculated on our system.

   Furthermore, it runs the important functions from the NEB routine together with the dummy potential and tests whether all functions return the correct values. The tested functions are:
   - Alignment
   - Interpolation (Cartesian, Internal ([z-matrix](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.27029)), [geodesic](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5090303) (non-deterministic) and [IDPP](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4878664))
   - NEB gradients (tangents, springs, complete NEB-gradient)
   - Step predictors (SD, AMGD, RFO, SCT)

   The test returns a file `test.log` to your current directory. You should get CHECK for all tested functions (except geodesic).

---

**The GöNEB program is now ready to use!**


# Calculating NEBs
1. **Set up a job directory.**

   **OPTION 1:** Use the whole directory as input for the GöNEB

      - This directory must include exactly *one* `*.ini` file with the options for the NEB
      - It is possible to define start, end and TS structures in the ini-file via their path. This way the xyz-structures may be located elsewhere
      - It is also possible to not specify the input structures. When choosing this option you should name your structures `*1*.xyz` for the start structure, `*2*.xyz` for the end structure and `*TS*.xyz` for the TS if you want to include this structure. If your naming was not recognized by the program, you will get a warning and the structures are sorted alphabetically.

   **OPTION 2:** Use the `*.ini` file as the only input for the GöNEB program. You need to specify at least the start and end structure via their path in the ini file. They may be located anywhere on your system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can find further information on how to write the ini file later in this ReadMe.
> 
> Also: An example for a complete calculation is in the folder `goeneb/testjobs/example`. There you can see a complete
> input and output.

---

2. **Run the program**
   
   Run the `scripts/run_NEB.sh`. This sets up the environment, runs the program and then deletes the temporary files.

---

The program will produce:
- `batchlog.out`: The slurm output, preferably this file should stay almost empty
- `output.log`: The NEB output, all info you need to follow the NEB calculation
- `results`:
    - `starttraj.xyz`: The starting trajectory of the NEB
    - `currenttraj.xyz`: The current trajectory during the NEB calculation. Continuously updated while the job is running.
    - `finaltraj.xyz`: The final trajectory (not necessarily converged)
    - `optlog.csv`: A csv file with different properties for tracking the calculation that can be visualized with the `optplot.py` program
    - `HEI.xyz` and `HEI_trj.xyz`: The highest energy image and its trajectory over the course of the NEB optimization
    - `TS_guess.xyz` and `TS_trj.xyz`: A linear interpolation of the images with the highest energy, that should be closest to the actual TS and its trajectory over the course of the NEB optimization

---

# Keywords
The `neb.ini` file should contain all options of the NEB calculation. It starts with the line:
```ini
[options]
```
Each subsequent line should be structured like: 
```ini
keyword = value
```

All keywords are explained in the following tables, default values are printed **bold**.

# Visualization with optplot

The optplot.py program transforms the optlog.csv file into nice, readable output. To visualize, follow these steps:

1. Open your NEB environment<br>
```bash
source path/to/neb-env/bin/activate
```
2. Run the program with<br>
```bash
path/to/goeneb/optplot.py -f path/to/optlog.csv
```

The program has the following arguments (can also be accessed by `path-to/goeneb/optplot.py --help`):

| short argument | long argument | Description |
|---|---|---|
|-f |--filename|Enter the file that should be visualized. No file opens the user input.|
|-s|--savefile|Enter the path where the file should be saved. No file means displaying the image directly.|

The optplot software gives you 4 different plots to visualize the progress of the NEB:

1. The progression of the convergence measures over the iterations.
2. The energy profile of the reaction, the energy profiles of previous iterations are also shown in lesser occupacity.
3. A 2-D projection of the image coordinates. The initial pathway is also shown and the movement of the images is tracked.
4. The energy gradient for each image in each iteration as a visualized matrix.

# The 2D example
The GöNEB comes with a two dimensional NEB model. It uses the functions in the real GöNEB but a model PES which is Himmelblaus function. On this 2D surface the NEB runs instantly and produces results that are easy to analyze since the optimization is in only 2 dimension. This can be used for visualization and testing of various functions.

The code for the 2D example can be run by the following command:
```bash
python /path/to/goeneb/2dtest.py -f <filename> -m <step-prediction-method>
```
The other arguments that can be parsed by the program are:

| Short | Long| Description|
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| -s| --stepsize_fac   | Step size factor|
| -m| --step_pred_method | Step predictor method (`AMGD`, `SD`, `RFO`, etc.)|
| -k    | --k_const| Spring constant|
| -t    | --tangents| Tangents calculation method (`henkjon`, `simple`)|
| -i    | --maxiter| Maximum number of iterations|
